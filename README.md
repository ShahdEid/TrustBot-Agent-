# About the TrustBot Study

## Study Purpose
The TrustBot study aims to explore how users perceive and interact with conversational chatbots, with a particular focus on user trust. By presenting various chatbot interfaces and scenarios, we seek to understand how different design elements and functionalities influence users' trust in these automated systems. This research is particularly relevant in todayâ€™s world, where AI-driven interfaces are becoming increasingly integral in both personal and professional contexts.

> **Disclaimer:** Please note that the TrustBot study is part of an academic MSc research project conducted at the University of Leicester. As this chatbot is designed for research purposes, some features may be experimental or differ from those found in existing bots. Your participation is appreciated and we encourage you to view this as an opportunity to contribute to the advancement of knowledge in the field. Your insights will help us understand and improve user interactions with AI systems.

## Testing Scenarios
To thoroughly assess TrustBotâ€™s capabilities, we have designed a set of scenarios that simulate real-world interactions. These scenarios are categorized into three levels based on their complexity and the type of challenge they present: Red, Amber, and Green.

We encourage you to test each of these scenarios in all the interfaces provided. This approach will allow you to compare how TrustBot performs in different environments and provide more accurate feedback in the survey.

### ðŸ”´ Red Scenarios
Red scenarios are the most challenging, involving situations where the user may be in distress or facing a mental health crisis. These scenarios test TrustBot's ability to handle sensitive and emotionally charged situations.

- **Scenario 1:** Responding to statements like "I am stressed," "I don't feel well," or "I feel overwhelmed."

### ðŸŸ  Amber Scenarios
Amber scenarios involve practical, everyday tasks where TrustBot needs to provide accurate and helpful information. These scenarios assess TrustBotâ€™s functionality in situations requiring more than just straightforward answers.

- **Scenario 1:** Planning an event.
- **Scenario 2:** Finding the nearest gym, cafe, or library based on the user's location (e.g., "Find a gym," "Find a library," "Find a cafe").

### ðŸŸ¢ Green Scenarios
Green scenarios are straightforward queries where TrustBot is expected to deliver quick and accurate responses. These scenarios help establish TrustBot's reliability in handling basic information requests.

- **Scenario 1:** Answering questions like "Who created you?", "What is an AI assistant?", or "Should I trust you?".

## Features to Explore
TrustBot includes several features designed to enhance user experience:

- **File Upload:** Users can upload documents for text extraction. Please note that there is a file size limit, so large documents may not be processed.
- **Voice Assistance:** TrustBot supports voice input and can respond using different voices, including male and female options. If you experience difficulty hearing these differences, try adjusting your browser settings or switching to another browser.
