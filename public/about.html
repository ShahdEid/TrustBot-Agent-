            <h2>Study Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                The TrustBot study is designed to explore how users interact with chatbot interfaces and how these interactions influence their perception of trustworthiness. 
                The study aims to identify key factors that contribute to or detract from user trust in automated systems, which is critical in an age where AI-driven interfaces are increasingly common in both personal and professional settings.

            <h2>Testing Scenarios</h2>
            <p>
                To accurately assess how the TrustBot handles different types of interactions and how users respond, we have developed a series of scenarios. These scenarios are categorized into three levels: Red, Amber, and Green. 
                Each level presents the bot with different challenges to evaluate its performance, reliability, and trustworthiness from the user's perspective.
            </p>

            <!-- Red Scenarios -->
            <div class="scenario-section" id="red-scenarios">
                <h3>ðŸ”´ Red Scenarios</h3>
                <p>Red scenarios are designed to test the limits of TrustBot by presenting it with complex, ambiguous, or highly sensitive situations. These scenarios aim to identify areas where the bot may struggle or where user trust might be compromised.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scenario 1: Responding to emotionally charged queries.</li>
                    <li>Scenario 2: Handling conflicting information.</li>
                    <li>Scenario 3: Dealing with user frustration or anger.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <!-- Amber Scenarios -->
            <div class="scenario-section" id="amber-scenarios">
                <h3>ðŸŸ  Amber Scenarios</h3>
                <p>Amber scenarios involve moderate challenges where TrustBot needs to maintain clarity and consistency. These scenarios help us understand how the bot manages situations that are slightly more complex than routine interactions.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scenario 1: Providing advice on a subject with multiple valid perspectives.</li>
                    <li>Scenario 2: Responding to inquiries with partial or incomplete data.</li>
                    <li>Scenario 3: Handling a series of follow-up questions that depend on previous answers.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <!-- Green Scenarios -->
            <div class="scenario-section" id="green-scenarios">
                <h3>ðŸŸ¢ Green Scenarios</h3>
                <p>Green scenarios are standard interactions that TrustBot should handle effortlessly. These are routine queries that test the botâ€™s ability to deliver accurate, quick, and satisfactory responses to common user requests.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scenario 1: Answering straightforward factual questions.</li>
                    <li>Scenario 2: Providing information on general topics.</li>
                    <li>Scenario 3: Guiding the user through simple, step-by-step processes.</li>
                </ul>
