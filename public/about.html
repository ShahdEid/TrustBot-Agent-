            <h2>Study Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                The TrustBot study aims to explore how users perceive and interact with conversational chatbots, with a particular focus on user trust.
                By presenting various chatbot interfaces and scenarios, we seek to understand how different design elements and functionalities influence users' trust in these automated systems.
                This research is particularly relevant in todayâ€™s world, where AI-driven interfaces are becoming increasingly integral in both personal and professional contexts.
            </p>
            <p class="alert alert-warning">
                <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Please note that the TrustBot study is part of an academic MSc research project conducted at the University of Leicester. As this chatbot is designed for research purposes, some features may be experimental or differ from those found in existing bots. Your participation is appreciated and we encourage you to view this as an opportunity to contribute to the advancement of knowledge in the field. Your insights will help us understand and improve user interactions with AI systems.

        <!-- Scenarios Section -->
        <section id="scenarios">
            <h2>Testing Scenarios</h2>
            <p>
                To thoroughly assess TrustBotâ€™s capabilities, we have designed a set of scenarios that simulate real-world interactions. These scenarios are categorised into three levels based on their complexity and the type of challenge they present: Red, Amber, and Green.
            </p>
            <p>
                We encourage you to test each of these scenarios in all the interfaces provided. This approach will allow you to compare how TrustBot performs in different environments and provide more accurate feedback in the survey.
            </p>
            <!-- Red Scenarios -->
            <div class="scenario-section" id="red-scenarios">
                <h3>ðŸ”´ Red Scenarios</h3>
                <p>
                    Red scenarios are the most challenging, involving situations where the user may be in distress or facing a mental health crisis. These scenarios test TrustBot's ability to handle sensitive and emotionally charged situations.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> Responding to statements like "I am stressed," "I don't feel well," or "I feel overwhelmed."</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <!-- Amber Scenarios -->
            <div class="scenario-section" id="amber-scenarios">
                <h3>ðŸŸ  Amber Scenarios</h3>
                <p>
                    Amber scenarios involve practical, everyday tasks where TrustBot needs to provide accurate and helpful information. These scenarios assess TrustBotâ€™s functionality in situations requiring more than just straightforward answers.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> Planning an event.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> Finding the nearest gym, cafe, or library based on the user's location (e.g., "Find a gym," "Find a library," "Find a cafe").</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <!-- Green Scenarios -->
            <div class="scenario-section" id="green-scenarios">
                <h3>ðŸŸ¢ Green Scenarios</h3>
                <p>
                    Green scenarios are straightforward queries where TrustBot is expected to deliver quick and accurate responses. These scenarios help establish TrustBot's reliability in handling basic information requests.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> Answering questions like "Who created you?", "What is an AI assistant?", or "Should I trust you?".</li>
